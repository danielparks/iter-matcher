# Change log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## main branch

* Added trivial documentation about what errors are returned by a few functions.
* Disabled [`clippy::single_match_else`] lint (part of [Clippy]â€™s [pedantic lint
  group]) within generated match functions, since we sometimes generate `match`
  statements with a single arm.
